ADISE22_Sindopoly
=================
A simplified "hardcore" and much faster version of the Monopoly board game
The API was a solo project of Dimitris Kopsidas.
Although some effort was taken to create a GUI in HTML using JQuery,AJAX and CSS it was too much for a solo project to deliver on time

To get all the information of the current game in JSON form.The JSON file is then pruned by different methods and sent to the frontend when needed.Because the project was a solo endeavor creation of a GUI was not possible to deliver on schedule.For this reason most methods dont return JSON data but 'echo' text to be more easily understood in Postman.
